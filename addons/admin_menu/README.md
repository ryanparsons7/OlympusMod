## 1Tac Admin Tool
1Tac Admin Tool is an Arma 3 administration tool, designed to provide admins and session hosts with tools they can use.

If you wish to use this admin tool for your community ensure that you modify init.sqf  so that the included steam player IDs are removed, otherwise myself and 1Tac admins will have access to this tool if we come to your community. I would suggest you replace with trusted admins at your own community.

**To use in-game press:** Shift+F1

**Note:** You must be in single player mode, logged in to ingame admin or in the whitelist to use it.
